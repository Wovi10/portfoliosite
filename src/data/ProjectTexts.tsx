                This was my 'big' final project for 12th grade. We had to make a board game in C# windows forms.
                <br/>
                I opted for the game of Ludo. It could have been a lot better, but this was my first big thing ever,
                so it is nice for me to see where started.

                In our first year of college we got the chance to make a project for a company.
                <br/>
                We had to create a business architecture making tool.
                It had to be able to map out the business architecture in a printable and easily readable way.
                <br/>
                Also you had to be able to edit the map if needed. Some further details were of course also required like a login system.
                <br/>
                We managed all of this pretty well and learned a lot in the process.

                PREGA was a wonderful idea of our teacher in the last year of my bachelor's to make a website to track all kinds of racing things.
                <br/>
                These 'racing things' included competitions, matches, racers, teams...
                We had to be able to do all the basic CRUD things on it.
                <br/>
                This of course wouldn't have been much of a challenge without the need for a very elaborate relational database.
                So we had to design this database frm scratch. Everything was connected to something and some difficult choices had to be made.
                <br/>
                Overall this was kind of nice for the most part, but I prefer things like we did with PREGA or like I did at Melexis.
                The project on my Github is only a copy of the project and doesn't work since no servers are set up.
